Author: [Poon Athit S. ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/athit-srimachand/)
Technologies: Python, Machine Learning, Data Manipulation

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop 3 machine learning models focused on predicting business opportunities, enhancing the firm's revenue forecasting capabilities.

## 2. Model Overview
This project leverages the following technologies for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning modeling, evaluation, and interpretation:

### Advanced Data Manipulation:
- Parallel programming
- Temporal data engineering
- Complex feature engineering

### Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost):
- Utilizes CUDA GPU for accelerated computations

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Automatically tunes hyperparameters for optimal model performance with Bayesian Optimization
- K-fold Cross validation were included in the process

### Robust Model Evaluation:
- The example of metrics include recall, precision, Kappa score, balanced accuracy, AUC, F1-score, MAE, RMSE, and R-squred 

### Explainable Machine Learning:
- Perform Feature Important Analysis
- Utilizes SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for robust model interpretability

## 3. Outcomes
Findings and recommendations were presented to the company, significantly influencing the finance, new business, and client service teams. The opportunity closing classification model achieved high balanced accuracy across both testing and future datasets.

## 4. Data Source
The data used in this project were obtained from multiple sources within a B2B consulting firm in the UK.
